                      Income Share Agreements are pretty new, so we understand
                      you might need more information. Let us try to explain to you how the Alfie
                      Income Share Agreement works, to make sure you understand
                      why this gives you such a great value
                    </p>
                </div>
            </div>

        <div class="container-fluid lotsoftext-dark center">
          <h2>The basics: Income Share Agreements</h2>
          <p>
            An Income Share Agreement is defined as a contract between two
            parties, where one party provides a certain amount of financing to
            pay for the other party’s education. In return the other party
            promises, as per the contract, to pay a fixed percentage of their
            income – however that is defined – to the party that provided the
            financing.
          </p>
          <p>
            This means there are two main elements to an income share agreement:
            the fixed percentage of income that is paid by the student and the
            duration that the student will pay this.
          </p>
          <p>
            The percentage of income is fixed, no matter what the income is. The
            percentage is based on a certain expectation of the future earnings
            of the student, but if this is less than expected, or more than
            expected, the percentage will not change. That is both the risk and
            the upside for the investor.
          </p>

          <h2>The Alfie ISA: Students Meet Investors</h2>
          <p>
            At Alfie we have developed the ISA in such a way that it is most
            beneficial for students and investors: investors can invest in many
            students at the same time to reduce risks, while students can be
            completely independent from investors.
          </p>
          <p>
            Even better, if a student ends up getting rich, we are giving them
            the option to buy themselves out, so that they will never have to
            pay more than what is reasonable.
          </p>
          <p>
            Let’s explain the Alfie ISA with a little graph:

                <p class="arrow-right howitworks">
                   Alfie provides students with tuition financing, in return for
                   which students promise to pay Alfie a fixed percentage of
                   their income over a fixed period of time after their graduation:
                   the ISA is issued.

                <p class="arrow-both howitworks">
                  Alfie uses proprietary algorithms to evaluate a student’s future earning potential, and then determine what reasonable percentage of income that student will pay. We also support students through a broad network of students, investors and employers to help students achieve their goals.

                  Investors buy into a pooled fund consisting of numerous ISAs, and in doing so provide financing for students. Because many ISAs are bundled into a common fund, investors can share in the successes of multiple students, providing them with a low-risk investment opportunity.

          <h2>The Alfie advantages explained</h2>
          <h3>Graduate debt free</h3>
          <p>
            The Alfie ISA is an equity model, as opposed to a debt model. This
            might sound confusing, but it is really simpler than it seems: just
            like companies can give out stocks (equity) in exchange for a share
            of their future earnings, we let you give out stocks in your future
            income, for a fixed period of time. You will never have to worry
            about having debt, or paying off a debt: you just pay a fair
            percentage of your income, no matter what that income is, for a
            fixed period of time. After that time you don’t owe us anything,
            even if the total you paid is less than we invested in you.
          </p>
          <p>
            This gives you a risk-free education, flexibility after graduation,
            and an incentive for us to help you with your career.
          </p>

          <h3>Advance Your Career</h3>
          <p>
            We understand that you want more from your education than just a
            nice experience. You have an idea of the perfect career, and of
            course all the help you can get is welcome. We also understand that
            a career comes full of surprises, and that it is sometimes nice to
            have someone that has your back. We will be there for you at every
            step of the way and will do what we can to help you advance. Be it a
            UN diplomat or an investment banker, we will offer our network and
            our preparation tools to help you get there sooner. After all, now
            we have invested in you, your success is our success.
          </p>

          <h3>Stay Flexible</h3>
          <p>
            Our main reason to have started Alfie is to let you make career
            choices because they are the choices you want to make, not because
            you have to make them due to crippling debt. Because you pay a fixed
            percentage of your income you really don’t have to worry too much
            about what that income is: that risk is for us.
          </p>
          <p>
            Even better, the percentage we charge you will, early on in your
            career, always be less than what you would have to pay if you would
            make fixed loan repayments. This gives you greater disposable income
            early on in your career, when little differences matter a lot. The
            Alfie ISA therefore also gives you the flexibility to start a family,
            buy a house, or work a bit less.

          <h2>Some FAQs</h2>
          <h3>Is there any regulation on ISAs?</h3>
          <p>
            Yes, currently ISAs are considered investment contracts, and
            therefore are governed by the SEC. We have worked closely together
            with the SEC and the CFPB to assure that we are offering the best
            product for both students and investors.
          </p>
          <p>
            Additionally there is a new law currently introduced in congress,
            that would provide additional clarity. For example, it regulates the
            maximum duration and the maximum percentage that can be asked. We
            have designed our ISAs to be far below both proposed maxima, to
            ensure the best interest for students and investors.
          </p>

          <h3>Am I stuck to Alfie forever?</h3>
          <p>
            No! Absolutely not. The Alfie ISA is set for a fixed period of time,
            after which you will never have to worry about payments to Alfie again. Even
            better: with Alfie you can choose to buy a 'buy out'-option, that 
            allows you to buy yourself out whenever you are making a lot more 
            money than expected. That way you will never have to worry about paying 
            us too much.
          </p>

          <h3>How much money can I get?</h3>
          <p>
            That depends on the institution: we only provide up to what the
            institution thinks you need. This includes living expenses and
            tuition, but not more than that. This way we ensure that you never
            take out more money than is financially responsible.
          </p>
          
          <h3>What is the percentage of my income that I have to pay?</h3>
          <p>
            That is an excellent question of which the answer depends on two different variables:
            how much money you need and what your prospects for your future earnings are.
            As this is different for every person, we provide everybody with
            a tailored rate. This is calculated by our proprietary algorithms, based on
            factors like the degree you are pursuing and the school where
            you are pursuing that degree. By applying through the button above
            we can provide you with a tailored rate. Applying is free and without
            consequences, so no need to hold back.
